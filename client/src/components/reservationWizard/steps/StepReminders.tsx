        <p>Welcome to the online reservation form for Kasal atbp. Avenue. Please read the following reminders before proceeding:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            This form is for making a <strong>reservation request</strong>. Your items are not officially booked until confirmed by our staff.
          </li>
          <li>
            A payment is required to secure the availability of your chosen items for your event date.
